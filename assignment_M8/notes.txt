Summary:

This assignment must use regex statements and test each regexp rule for a user password required to meet complexity requirements. While a single regexp could be made to cover the all rules, it is necessary to have one for each rule to let the user know which are met ( or not ).

Requirements:

Password rules:

One or more uppercase letter
One or more lower case letter
One or more number
One or more from this group @#$%^
Minimum Length 8 Characters

The tasks for this program are:


Create a new JavaScript file, and use the name "M8_Solution.js"

Within the above file:

Create a function, using "testPassword" as the identifier

testPassword:

This function will have three input parameters:

password , rulesRegexp, rulesText.

Will iterate the array of rulesRegexp testing each rule on the user provided password.

Within the iterate, display to the user a message from the array rulesText and the status of the regex test.

Return a boolean value ( true / false ), true is set only if all rules were met.


Create a function main, no input parameters

main:

Create two arrays, one containing the String messages ( see example output for the rules , you must code for all of them ) and one for the RegExp objects.

Display to the user the password requirements ( use the created text array ).

Prompt the user for the Password to verify.

Call  testPassword passing the two arrays and user supplied password.


Last line of the script, would be the call to the main

Below is an example output, all console messages should match ( color change not required for full points )

!!BONUS:!!

In the example below the passed/fail messages are in green/red. Research ( online  ) and implement this feature for a 1 point bonus!
