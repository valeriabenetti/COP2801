• Arrays
• Random Numbers
• variables
• simple data types
• expressions
• loops
Please refer back to the module lectures if you find you have any gaps in your

Introduction
Create a script called retail_store.js. In this script code the following:
A. Class and Constructor Creation (25 Points)
 RetailItem Class
 Create a constructor function or ES6 class for a RetailItem object. The RetailItem
object should store the following data in attributes: item description, units in inventory,
and price.
 CashRegister Class (25 points)
 Create a constructor function or ES6 class for a CashRegister object that will be
used with the RetailItem class. The CashRegister object should be able to internally
keep an array of RetailItem objects.
B. Methods to add (25 Points)
 CashRegister Class

 The class should have the following methods:
o A method named purchaseItem that accepts a RetailItem object as an
argument. Each time the purchaseItem method is called, the RetailItem
object that is passed as an argument should be added to the list of
retailItems the CashRegister contains.
o A method named getTotal that returns the total price of all the RetailItem
objects stored in the CashRegister objects internal list.
o A method named showItems that writes the information about each retail
item stored in the cash register to the console.
o A method named clear that should clear CashRegister object’s internal
list.

C. Test Program 25 Points
After you have created the classes. Create three RetailItem objects and store the
following data in them:
Description Units In Inventory Price
Item #1 Polo Jacket 12 59.95
Item #2 Roberto
Cavalli Jeans
40 34.95
Item #3 Sean Jean Shirt 20 24.95
Store all three RetailItem objects in an array named “inventory”.
Next, create a CashRegister object.
Add all the items to the CashRegister using the purchaseItem method. Display the total
using the CashRegister getTotal method. Display all the items using the CashRegister
showItems method.
Save retail_store.js in a folder named Assignment_5. Zip that folder and submit in
the Assignment 5 Dropbox.
